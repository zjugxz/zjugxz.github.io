    abstract  =   {This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of MagWear, a novel biomagnetism-based system that can accurately and inclusively monitor the heart rate and respiration rate of mobile users with diverse skin tones. MagWear's contributions are twofold. Firstly, we build a mathematical model that characterizes the magnetic coupling effect of blood flow under the influence of an external magnetic field. This model uncovers the variations in accuracy when monitoring vital signs among individuals. Secondly, leveraging insights derived from this mathematical model, we present a softwarehardware co-design that effectively handles the impact of human diversity on the performance of vital sign monitoring, pushing this generic solution one big step closer to real adoptions. We have implemented a prototype of MagWear on a two-layer PCB board and followed IRB protocols to conduct system evaluations. Our extensive experiments involving 30 volunteers demonstrate that MagWear achieves high monitoring accuracy with a mean percentage error (MPE) of 1.55% for heart rate and 1.79% for respiration rate. The head-tohead comparison with Apple Watch 8 further demonstrates MagWear's consistently high performance in different user conditions.}

    abstract = {Backscatter is an enabling technology for battery-free sensing in today's Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIOT). Building a backscatter-based sensing system, however, is a daunting task, due to two obstacles: the unaffordable power consumption of the microprocessor and the coexistence with the ambient carrier's traffic. In order to address the above issues, in this paper, we present Leggiero, the first-of-its-kind analog WiFi backscatter with payload transparency. Leveraging a specially designed circuit with a varactor diode, this design avoids using a microprocessor to interface between the radio and the sensor, and directly converts the analog sensor signal into the phase of RF (radio frequency) signal. By carefully designing the reference circuit on the tag and precisely locating the extra long training field (LTF) section of a WiFi packet, Leggiero embeds the analog phase value into the channel state information (CSI). A commodity WiFi receiver without hardware modification can simultaneously decode the WiFi and the sensor data. We implement Leggiero design and evaluate its performance under varied settings. The results show that the power consumption of the Leggiero tag (excluding the power of the peripheral sensor module) is 30μW at a sampling rate of 400Hz, which is 4.8\texttimes{} and 4\texttimes{} lower than the state-of-the-art WiFi backscatter schemes. The uplink throughput of Leggiero is suficient to support a variety of sensing applications, while keeping the WiFi carrier's throughput performance unaffected.},

    abstract = {The ever-developing Internet of Things (IoT) brings the prosperity of wireless sensing and control applications. In many scenarios, different wireless technologies coexist in the shared frequency medium as well as the physical space. Such wireless coexistence may lead to serious cross-technology interference (CTI) problems, e.g., channel competition, signal collision, and throughput degradation. Compared with traditional methods like interference avoidance, tolerance, and concurrency mechanism, direct and timely information exchange among heterogeneous devices is therefore a fundamental requirement to ensure the usability, inter-operability, and reliability of the IoT. Under this circumstance, Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) technique thus becomes a hot topic in both academic and industrial fields, which aims at directly exchanging data among heterogeneous devices that follow different standards. This paper comprehensively summarizes the CTC techniques and reveals that the key challenge for CTC lies in the heterogeneity of IoT devices, including the incompatibility of technical standards and the asymmetry of connection capability. Based on the above finding, we present a taxonomy of the existing CTC works (packet-level CTCs and physical-level CTCs) and compare the existing CTC techniques in terms of throughput, reliability, hardware modification, and concurrency.},

    abstract = {This paper presents RF-Transformer, a unified backscatter radio hardware abstraction that allows a low-power IoT device to directly communicate with heterogeneous wireless receivers at the minimum power consumption. Unlike existing backscatter systems that are tailored to a specific wireless communication protocol, RF-Transformer provides a programmable interface to the micro-controller, allowing IoT devices to synthesize different types of protocol-compliant backscatter signals sharing radically different PHY-layer designs. To show the efficacy of our design, we implement a PCB prototype of RF-Transformer on 2.4 GHz ISM band and showcase its capability on generating standard ZigBee, Bluetooth, LoRa, and Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n/ac packets. Our extensive field studies show that RF-Transformer achieves 23.8 Mbps, 247.1 Kbps, 986.5 Kbps, and 27.3 Kbps throughput when generating standard Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Bluetooth, and LoRa signals while consuming 7.6--74.2X less power than their active counterparts. Our ASIC simulation based on the 65-nm CMOS process shows that the power gain of RF-Transformer can further grow to 92--678X. We further integrate RF-Transformer with pressure sensors and present a case study on detecting foot traffic density in hallways. Our 7-day case studies demonstrate RF-Transformer can reliably transmit sensor data to a commodity gateway by synthesizing LoRa packets on top of Wi-Fi signals. Our experimental results also verify the compatibility of RF-Transformer with commodity receivers. Code and hardware schematics can be found at: https://github.com/LeFsCC/RF-Transformer.},

    abstract = {The radio range of backscatter systems continues growing as new wireless communication primitives are continuously invented. Nevertheless, both the bit error rate and the packet loss rate of backscatter signals increase rapidly with the radio range, thereby necessitating the cooperation between the access point and the backscatter tags through a feedback loop. Unfortunately, the low-power nature of backscatter tags limits their ability to demodulate feedback signals from a remote access point and scales down to such circumstances.
This paper presents Saiyan, an ultra-low-power demodulator for long-range LoRa backscatter systems. With Saiyan, a backscatter tag can demodulate feedback signals from a remote access point with moderate power consumption and then perform an immediate packet re-transmission in the presence of packet loss. Moreover, Saiyan enables rate adaption and channel hopping – two PHY-layer operations that are important to channel efficiency yet unavailable on long-range backscatter systems. We prototype Saiyan on a two-layer PCB board and evaluate its performance in different environments. Results show that Saiyan achieves 3.5–5× gain on the demodulation range, compared with state-of-the-art systems. Our ASIC simulation shows that the power consumption of Saiyan is around 93.2 µW.

    abstract = {Wireless sensing has great significance in Internet of Things (IoT) applications and has attracted substantial research interests in academia. In this study, we propose Palantir, a first-of-its-kind long-range sensing system based on the LoRa backscatter technology. By utilizing the ON-OFF-Keying modulated backscatter signals, Palantir can perform fine-grained long-range cyclist sensing. Our findings show that sensing is more susceptible to channel quality than communication. Hence, the design of Palantir particularly addresses the critical challenges of signal processing, such as amplitude instability, frequency offset, clock drift, spectrum leakage, and multiplicative noise. We implement Palantir and evaluate its performance by conducting comprehensive benchmark experiments. A prototype is also built and a case study of respiration monitoring in the real world is implemented. Results demonstrate that Palantir can perform accurate sensing at a range up to 100 m, which is twice that of state-of-the-art approaches. The median deviation of the detected motion period is as low as 0.2\%.},

    abstract = {Backscatter communication holds potential for ubiquitous and low-cost connectivity among low-power IoT devices. To avoid interference between the carrier signal and the backscatter signal, recent works propose a frequency-shifting technique to separate these two signals in the frequency domain. Such proposals, however, have to occupy the precious wireless spectrum that is already overcrowded, and increase the power, cost, and complexity of the backscatter tag. In this paper, we revisit the classic ON-OFF Keying (OOK) modulation and propose Aloba, a backscatter system that takes the ambient LoRa transmissions as the excitation and piggybacks the in-band OOK modulated signals over the LoRa transmissions. Our design enables the backsactter signal to work in the same frequency band of the carrier signal, meanwhile achieving good tradeoff between transmission range and link throughput. The key contributions of Aloba include: i) the design of a low-power backscatter tag that can pick up the ambient LoRa signals from other signals; ii) a novel decoding algorithm to demodulate both the carrier signal and the backscatter signal from their superposition. The design of Aloba completely unleashes the backscatter tag's ability in OOK modulation and achieves flexible data rate at different transmission range. We implement Aloba and conduct head-to-head comparison with the state-of-the-art LoRa backscatter system PLoRa in various settings. The experiment results show Aloba can achieve 39.5--199.4 Kbps data rate at various distances, 10.4--52.4X higher than PLoRa.},

    abstract = {The proliferation of IoT applications brings the demand of ubiquitous connections among heterogeneous wireless devices. Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) is a significant technique to directly exchange data among heterogeneous devices that follow different standards. By exploiting a side-channel like frequency, amplitude, or temporal modulation, the existing works enable CTC but have limited performance under channel noise. In this article, we propose WiZig, a novel CTC technique from WiFi to ZigBee that employs modulations in both the amplitude and temporal dimensions to optimize the throughput over a noisy channel. We establish a theoretical model of the energy communication channel to clearly understand the channel capacity. We then devise an online rate adaptation algorithm to adjust the modulation strategy according to the channel condition. Based on the theoretical model, WiZig controls the number of encoded energy amplitudes and the length of a receiving window, so as to optimize the CTC throughput. We implement a prototype of WiZig on a software radio platform and a commercial ZigBee device. The evaluation shows that WiZig achieves a throughput of 153.85bps with less than 1% symbol error rate in a real environment.},

Recent works in this area have made substantial progress, but CTC from ZigBee to WiFi remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose ZigFi, a novel CTC framework that enables communication from ZigBee to WiFi. ZigFi carefully overlaps ZigBee packets with WiFi packets.

Moreover, we extend ZigFi to multiple-to-one concurrent transmissions. We implement ZigFi on commercial-off-the-shelf WiFi and ZigBee devices. We evaluate the performance of ZigFi under different experimental settings. The results demonstrate that ZigFi achieves a throughput of 215.9bps, which is 18X faster than the state of the arts.},

The state of the art on CTC employs physical-level emulation. Due to the protocol incompatibility and the hardware restriction, there are intrinsic emulation errors between the emulated signals and the legitimate signals. Unresolved emulation errors hurt the reliability of CTC and the achievable throughput, but how to improve the reliability of CTC remains a challenging problem. Taking the CTC from WiFi to BLE as an example, this work first presents a comprehensive understanding of the emulation errors. We then propose WEB, a practical CTC approach that can be implemented with commercial devices. The core design of WEB is split encoding: based on the probabilistic distribution of emulation errors, the WiFi sender manipulates its payload to maximize the successful decoding rate at the BLE receiver. We implement WEB and evaluate its performance with extensive experiments. Compared to two existing approaches, WEBee and WIDE, WEB reduces the SER (Symbol Error Rate) by 54.6\% and 42.2\%, respectively. For the first time in the community, WEB achieves practically effective CTC from WiFi to BLE, with an average throughput of 522.2 Kbps.},

    abstract = {Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) is an emerging technique that enables direct communication across different wireless technologies. Recent works achieve physical-level CTC by emulating the standard time-domain waveform of the receiver. This method faces the challenges of inherent unreliability due to the imperfect emulation. Different from analog emulation, we propose a novel concept named digital emulation, which stems from the following insight: The receiver relies on the phase shift to decode symbols rather than the shape of analog time-domain waveform. There are lots of phase sequences which satisfy the requirement of phase shift. The distortions of these phase sequences after WiFi emulation are different. We have the opportunity to select an appropriate phase sequence with the relatively small emulation errors to achieve a reliable CTC. The key point of digital emulation is generic and applicable to a set of CTCs, where the transmitter has a wider bandwidth for emulation and the receiver decoding is based on the phase shift. In this paper, we implement our proposal as WIDE, a physical-level CTC via digital emulation from WiFi to ZigBee. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of WIDE. The results show that WIDE significantly improves the Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) from 41.7% to 86.2%, which is 2× of WEBee's, an existing representative physical-level CTC.},

Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) is a significant technique to directly exchange information among heterogeneous devices that follow different standards. By exploiting a side-channel like frequency, amplitude or temporal modulation, the existing works enable CTC but have limited performance under channel noise. In this paper, we propose WiZig, a novel CTC technique that employs modulation techniques in both the amplitude and temporal dimensions to optimize the throughput over a noisy channel. We establish a theoretical model of the energy communication channel to clearly understand the channel capacity. We then devise an online rate adaptation algorithm to adjust the modulation strategy according to the channel condition. Based on the theoretical model, WiZig can accurately control the number of encoded energy amplitudes and the length of a receiving window, so as to optimize the CTC throughput. We implement a prototype of WiZig on a software radio platform and a commercial ZigBee device. The evaluation show that WiZig achieves a throughput of 153.85 bps with less than 1 % symbol error rate in a real environment. The results demonstrate that WiZig realizes efficient and reliable CTC under varied channel conditions.},

    abstract = {iBeacon protocol is widely deployed to provide location-based services. By receiving its BLE advertisements, nearby devices can estimate the proximity to the iBeacon or calculate indoor positions. However, the open nature of these advertisements brings vulnerability to impersonation attacks. Such attacks could lead to spam, unreliable positioning, and even security breaches. In this paper, we propose Wi-attack, revealing the feasibility of using WiFi devices to conduct impersonation attacks on iBeacon services. Different from impersonation attacks using BLE compatible hardware, Wi-attack is not restricted by broadcasting intervals and is able to impersonate multiple iBeacons at the same time. Effective attacks can be launched on iBeacon services without modifications to WiFi hardware or firmware. To enable direct communication from WiFi to BLE, we use the digital emulation technique of cross technology communication. To enhance the packet reception along with its stability, we add redundant packets to eliminate cyclic prefix error entirely. The emulation provides an iBeacon packet reception rate up to 66.2%. We conduct attacks on three iBeacon services scenarios, point deployment, multilateration, and fingerprint-based localization. The evaluation results show that Wi-attack can bring an average distance error of more than 20 meters on fingerprint-based localization using only 3 APs.},

    abstract = {Research on Cross-technology communication (CTC) has made rapid progress in recent years, but how to estimate the quality of a CTC link remains an open and challenging problem. Through our observation and study, we find that none of the existing approaches can be applied to estimate the link quality of CTC. Built upon the physical-level emulation, transmission over a CTC link is jointly affected by two factors: the emulation error and the channel distortion. We in this paper propose a new link metric called C-LQI and a joint link model that simultaneously takes into account the emulation error and the channel distortion in the process of CTC. We further design a light-weight link estimation approach to estimate C-LQI and in turn the PRR over the CTC link. We implement C-LQI and compare it with two representative link estimation approaches. The results demonstrate that C-LQI reduces the relative error of link estimation respectively by 46% and 53% and saves the communication cost by 90%.},

However, a critical problem that may impede the further development of smart home is overlooked: Small appliances account for the majority of home appliances, but they receive little attention and most of them are cut off from the Internet. To fill this gap, we propose MotorBeat, an acoustic communication approach that connects small appliances to a smart speaker. Our key idea is to exploit direct current (DC) motors, which are common components of small appliances, to transmit acoustic messages. We design a novel scheme named Variable Pulse Width Modulation (V-PWM) to drive DC motors. MotorBeat achieves the following 3C goals: (1) Comfortable to hear, (2) Compatible with multiple motor modes, and (3) Concurrent transmission. We implement MotorBeat with commercial devices and evaluate its performance on three small appliances and ten DC motors. The results show that the communication range can be up to 10 m.},

    abstract = {Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) is an emerging technology to support direct communication between wireless devices that follow different standards. In spite of the many different proposals from the community to enable CTC, the performance aspect of CTC is an equally important problem but has seldom been studied before. We find this problem is extremely challenging, due to the following reasons: on one hand, a link for CTC is essentially different from a conventional wireless link. The conventional link indicators like RSSI (received signal strength indicator) and SNR (signal to noise ratio) cannot be used to directly characterize a CTC link. On the other hand, the indirect indicators like PER (packet error rate), which is adopted by many existing CTC proposals, cannot capture the short-term link behavior. As a result, the existing CTC proposals fail to keep reliable performance under dynamic channel conditions. In order to address the above challenge, we in this paper propose AdaComm, a generic framework to achieve self-adaptive CTC in dynamic channels. Instead of reactively adjusting the CTC sender, AdaComm adopts online learning mechanism to adaptively adjust the decoding model at the CTC receiver. The self-adaptive decoding model automatically learns the effective features directly from the raw received signals that are embedded with the current channel state. With the lossless channel information, AdaComm further adopts the fine tuning and full training modes to cope with the continuous and abrupt channel dynamics. We implement AdaComm and integrate it with two existing CTC approaches that respectively employ CSI (channel state information) and RSSI as the information carrier. The evaluation results demonstrate that AdaComm can significantly reduce the SER (symbol error rate) by 72.9% and 49.2%, respectively, compared with the existing approaches.},

    abstract={Cross- Technology Communication (CTC) is an emerging technique to enable the direct communication among different wireless technologies. A main category of the existing proposals on CTC propose to modulate packets at the sender side, and demodulate them into 1 and 0 bits at the receiver side. The performance of those proposals is likely to degrade in a densely coexisting environment. Solely judged according to the received signal strength, a symbol 0 that is modulated as packet absence is generally indistinguishable from dynamic interference. In this paper, we propose StripComm, interference-resilient CTC in coexisting environments. A sender in StripComm adopts an interference-resilient coding scheme that contains both presence and absence of packets in one symbol. The receiver strips the interference from the interested signal by exploiting the self-similarity of StripComm signals. We prototype StripComm with commercial WiFi, ZigBee devices and a software radio platform. The theoretical and experimental evaluation demonstrate that StripComm offers a data rate up to 1.1K bps with a SER (Symbol Error Rate) lower than 0.01 and a data rate of 0.89K bps even against strong interference.},

    abstract = {Clock synchronization is a key function in embedded wireless systems and networks. This issue is equally important and more challenging in IoT systems nowadays, which often include heterogeneous wireless devices that follow different wireless standards. Conventional solutions to this problem employ gateway-based indirect synchronization, which suffer low accuracy. This paper for the first time studies the problem of cross-technology clock synchronization. Our proposal called Crocs synchronizes WiFi and ZigBee devices by direct cross-technology communication. Crocs decouples the synchronization signal from the transmission of a timestamp. By incorporating a barker-code based beacon for time alignment and cross-technology transmission of timestamps, Crocs achieves robust and accurate synchronization among WiFi and ZigBee devices, with the synchronization error lower than 1 millisecond. We further make attempts to implement different cross-technology communication methods in Crocs and provide insight findings with regard to the achievable accuracy and expected overhead.},

    abstract={The application of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) often falls into unexpected poor performance conditions due to many factors such as complex network interactions, software bugs and incorrect configurations. Diagnosing such a network is challenging since it is difficult to obtain information from the network due to factors including (1) non-deterministic network interactions among motes, (2) difficulties in reconstructing the status of each individual mote, and (3) unavailability of the real environment information. To address these problems, we propose a diagnosis tool called ALog which analyzes the local logs and the source code to infer what happens in network. Based on the analysis, we further derive the states and possible problems accordingly. We implement ALog and evaluate its efficiency with two real case studies. The results demonstrate that ALog is accurate and applicable for diagnosing real sensor networks.},

Meanwhile, a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is implemented in conjunction with support vector machine (SVM) for realizing a synchronization optimization of the sensor array and SVM model parameters. The results prove the efficacy of the proposed method for E-nose feature extraction, which can lead to a higher classification accuracy rate compared to other established techniques. Meanwhile it is interesting to note that different classification results can be obtained by changing the types, widths or positions of windows. By selecting the optimum window function for the sensor response, the performance of an E-nose can be enhanced.},

For a specific application, the feature extraction method is a basic part of these three optimizations and a key point in E-nose system performance improvement. The aim of a feature extraction method is to extract robust information from the sensor response with less redundancy to ensure the effectiveness of the subsequent pattern recognition algorithm. Many kinds of feature extraction methods have been used in E-nose applications, such as extraction from the original response curves, curve fitting parameters, transform domains, phase space (PS) and dynamic moments (DM), parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), energy vector (EV), power density spectrum (PSD), window time slicing (WTS) and moving window time slicing (MWTS), moving window function capture (MWFC), etc. The object of this review is to provide a summary of the various feature extraction methods used in E-noses in recent years, as well as to give some suggestions and new inspiration to propose more effective feature extraction methods for the development of E-nose technology.},
