Over the last decade,we have witnessed the explosive growth of wireless technologies in diversity (e.g., WiFi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth) as well as in density, to satisfy various communication and service requirements under different environments. Under the highly diversified and dense wireless habitat, the connectivity between specialized heterogeneous wireless technologies offers a great opportunity for advanced services. To this end, researchers recently propose cross-technology communication (CTC) technique which enables direct connection between heterogeneities only using commodity devices. In this paper, we propose ZigFi, a novel CTC from ZigBee to WiFi. ZigFi deliberately overlaps ZigBee packets with WiFi packets and Channel State Information (CSI) is used to convey data. Evaluation results demonstrate that ZigFi achieves a throughput of 215.9bps, which is 18x faster than the state-of-the-art approach. This work appears in the proceedings of IEEE/ACM ToN 2020 and INFOCOM 2018.
